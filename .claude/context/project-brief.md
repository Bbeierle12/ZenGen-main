# Project Brief: ZenGen AI

## What It Does

ZenGen AI is a web-based AI-powered meditation and breathing exercise application. It allows users to:

1. **Generate Custom Meditations**: Create personalized guided meditation sessions using AI-generated scripts and text-to-speech audio
2. **Practice Breathing Exercises**: Follow guided breathing patterns with visual feedback and audio cues
3. **Track Progress**: Monitor meditation streaks, total time, and session history
4. **Customize Preferences**: Set default meditation settings including voice, soundscape, technique, and duration

## Why It Exists

The application addresses the need for:
- Personalized meditation experiences tailored to individual topics and preferences
- Guided breathing exercises with real-time visual and audio feedback
- A unified platform combining AI-generated content with ambient soundscapes

## Success Criteria

1. Users can generate meditation sessions with custom topics
2. AI-generated audio plays smoothly with ambient soundscapes
3. Breathing exercises provide clear visual/audio guidance
